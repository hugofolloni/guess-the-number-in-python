# GuessTheNumberInPython
A python project with the same objective that my previous JavaScript game to guess the random number. In this project, will be calculated a random number between 0 and 100. You have 10 chances to guess the right number. Every time you miss, will be displayed a message saying if your guess was too high or low.
